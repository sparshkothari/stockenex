Imagine, for a moment, having the keys to the stock market in the back of your pocket: you unlock the treasure chest that tells you exactly when to buy, when to sell, and when to wait. For many, life is too busy and precious to allocate a portion of its time to the mathematical madness and addictive nature of Wall-Street; yet, all people wish to make wise and modest investments in a proper manner as a parellel asset and capital generator to their normal job income. So, how do we solve this problem and give customers what they anxiously seek and deserve? Welcome to Stock En Ex: a platform that provides non-expert individuals the tools to wisely, quickly, and effortlessly take actions on their current and prospepective stock investments. The proposition is simple: provide users with an application that highlights the state of numerous stock symbols/companies with a color-code and easy-to-read trend analysis and pattern so that users can immediately see which stocks to invest in or wait on and which stocks to buy and sell at the right time. The application will do all the mathematical brain work for the user, so that the user only has to take out a few minutes of her day to manage and conduct her stock portfolio. 

Our product is still in development phase; we will soon have a demo server up of our application where users can visit the dashboard section of our site for a visual presentation on how it works. We can't wait for you to try our product!
